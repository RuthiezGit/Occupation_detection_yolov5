# Occupation_detection_yolov5
Object detection using yolov5master to detect occupation
There are three parts to this repository:
First is using the yolov5 master to detect objects in a picture. The yolov5 is a pre-trained model that was trained on 10 different classes, you can look it up on https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
Secondly is running the yolov5 model on real time to detect objects.
Thirdly is a Custom Object Detection Model i trained with YOLO v5. The model is trained to detect just three classes of occupation.
