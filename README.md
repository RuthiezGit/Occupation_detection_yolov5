# Occupation_detection_yolov5
Object detection using yolov5master to detect occupation
There are three parts to this repository:
First is using the yolov5 master to detect objects in a picture. The yolov5 is a pre-trained model that was trained on 10 different classes, you can download it from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
Secondly is running the yolov5 model in real time to detect objects.
Thirdly is a Custom Object Detection Model I trained with YOLO v5. The model is trained to detect just three classes of occupation. The dataset and codes for training this model can be found on https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VWwoWCU5vk8RQJulJhNt6NMX6y2gDnJr?usp=sharing and https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r-m0Xp5V9UUdIVitoeQ8qBscxWvm3gaf?usp=sharing respectively
You can watch the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRtgLlwxpc4&list=PPSV for steps on how to train your own custom model or follow https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=1NcFxRcFdJ_O
